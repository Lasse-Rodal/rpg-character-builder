# RPG Character Builder

A fantasy-themed character creator app built with React. Choose race and class, assign a name, view a pixel-art avatar, and customize the character's base stats. Built to resemble a parchment-style RPG sheet.

Users can:
- Select a race and class for their character
- Assign a name and preview a matching fantasy avatar
- View stats that change based on class and race
- Allocate extra stat points manually via interactive UI

## My Process

### Built With

- **React**
  - State management with `useState`
  - Conditional rendering and component logic
- **Custom CSS**
  - Fantasy-inspired parchment background
  - Font Awesome icons for class and stat presentation
- **Pixel Art Character Sprites**
  - Image paths tied to class/race selection

---

### What I Learned

In this project, I practiced:

- Using `useState` for layered state like race, class, stats, and points
- Dynamically changing UI content and images based on selections
- Styling React apps without Tailwind to achieve a thematic fantasy look
- Managing reusable base stats and class modifiers
- Displaying icons conditionally based on available points
